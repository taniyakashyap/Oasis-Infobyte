            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Kalpana Chawla was an American astronaut and the first woman of Indian origin in space. Born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, India, she immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen. Kalpana Chawla earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington and later a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado.

                In 1997, she made history by becoming the first woman of Indian origin in space during her first mission as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-87). Her achievements and contributions to space exploration made her a role model for aspiring astronauts and women in science.
                
                Tragically, Kalpana Chawla lost her life in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on February 1, 2003, during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite this unfortunate event, her legacy continues to inspire and motivate individuals globally, and she is remembered as a symbol of courage, determination, and a pioneer in the field of space exploration.</p>
